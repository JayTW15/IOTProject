Hello, welcome to my project. I plan on making this my first real project I put my effort into making in hopes of one day achieving my goal of a data engineer
This is an IOTproject that I plan on adding features and one day creating a front end, but for now we stick with the backend.
The main idea of this project is an IoT Sensor Monitoring Platform used to simulate IoT devices sending telemetry data, process it for anomalies, and create dashboards.

Tech stack: Kafka for sensor data ingestion,
Flink for anomaly detection,
PostgreSQL for device metadata,
ClickHouse for analytics,
Airflow for device onboarding and maintenance tasks,
Docker for containerization.

This is the day I start this project, my first goal is creating a realistic sensor generator that'll be used throughout this project
Lets say we are simulating a data center, we want to keep information on the temperatures of the computers (maybe later include the usage % of each server)

I have been working on this project throughout the days and its mainly been setting everything up to work properly, today I am learning how to set up custome flink images with python support using a dockerfile.
